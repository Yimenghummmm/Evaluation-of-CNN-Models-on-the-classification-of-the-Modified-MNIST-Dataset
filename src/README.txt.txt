Replicating Results
-------------------
Make sure you have your data files saved in the subdirectories mentioned in the notebook.
Remove any !pip install line codes as this is necessary for the kaggle kernels that we used
the notebooks with, but are not necessary if running on your local machine.
DataCleaning.ipynb includes all the data cleaning and noise filtering explorations we did

To replicate results for a certain model, navigate to the model file name and just run the
notebook. The only requirement is to have the data files saved to the corresponding subdirectory
mentioned in the notebook.
